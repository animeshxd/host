1
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:53,590
It's Alamoron

2
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:55,970
The toothless pterosaur was flying in the sky!

3
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:58,930
Look, it's a spiny dragon!

4
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:02,770
That's awesome!

5
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,310
It's a triceratops.

6
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,570
So cool

7
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,990
Baba baba baba baba baba

8
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,330
Why are you suddenly calling Daddy?

9
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:35,260
Tyrannosaurus rex

10
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:38,340
Do-do-do-do Doraemon

11
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:47,680
Is it okay?

12
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,900
Nobita, is everything all right?

13
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,280
Hey, hey, what are you afraid of?

14
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:04,330
How can there be real dinosaurs?

15
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,120
It's hard to say.

16
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:11,960
What are you talking about?

17
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,880
Somewhere in this world, there might still be dinosaurs alive.

18
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,970
So, Nobita...

19
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:24,760
Dinosaurs disappeared 66 million years ago.

20
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:26,850
Why

21
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:31,770
The Earth was hit by a huge meteorite and the dinosaurs became extinct.

22
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,570
How could

23
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,370
It's huge!

24
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,050
That's great

25
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,960
That's a flake dragon.

26
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:27,870
Nobita

27
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,460
Huh

28
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,760
It seems to have something

29
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:45,590
Where is it? Where is it?

30
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,010
That's it.

31
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,890
This is a fossilized dinoflagellate

32
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:51,230
It's great!

33
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,350
That's great, Fat Tiger.

34
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:54,390
Let me see

35
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,360
The fossil you found, you can take it back.

36
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,190
Last 5 years

37
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,490
Many dinosaur fossils have been found in Japan

38
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,240
Japan may have been a dinosaur kingdom.

39
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,370
Excuse me, is this a dinosaur fossil?

40
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,960
That's impressive.

41
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,210
No doubt it's a dinosaur's

42
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,290
No way!

43
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,290
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,290 An ordinary stone that trips over your foot

44
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:24,930
How could Nobita find the fossil of a dinosaur

45
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:28,350
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:28,350 If shit, it's possible to find it.

46
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,720
What's a fossil?

47
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,640
I'm here to announce

48
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,360
Not some fossil. I'm going to find a living dinosaur and show you.

49
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:42,440
Nobita

50
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,280
Okay, I'm recording.

51
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,950
What are you going to do if you don't find it?

52
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,580
What do you do?

53
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,290
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,290 Table: Showing you how to chew peanuts with your eyes

54
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:02,880
Here we go again.

55
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:05,670
How exciting!

56
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,390
The video of the evidence was also well captured

57
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,550
Wait for me.

58
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:13,100
I'll find a live dinosaur and leave those guys speechless.

59
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:16,940
In the world

60
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:20,190
There are still many undiscovered dinosaurs

61
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:24,230
That should have existed in the course of evolution, but were not discovered.

62
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,740
It hurts.

63
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,870
A new dinosaur buried in a transitional fossil like that

64
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,330
Perhaps it's up to you to discover it.

65
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,380
At that time

66
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,760
it will be possible to name the dinosaur after you

67
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:07,860
Doraemon Doraemon

68
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:09,650
doraemon doraemon doraemon doraemon

69
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,620
Doraemon Doraemon

70
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,950
Doraemon

71
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:41,280
Doraemon: Nobita's New Dinosaur

72
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,630
Dinosaur eggs?

73
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:55,010
Oh, you're so

74
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,680
Naive or innocent, I should say.

75
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,970
Give me back this shape, this size

76
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,850
It's a dinosaur egg from any angle.

77
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:05,900
Such naivety.

78
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,690
It's a good thing that you say it's a good thing that you are

79
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,650
But then

80
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:13,990
How do you know it's a dinosaur egg?

81
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,240
It could just be an ordinary stone.

82
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:19,280
Even if it's a fossil, it could be the fruit of an ancient tree.

83
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,790
00:08:21,790 It could be the poop of an archaic rhinoceros.

84
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,660
It's a bit of a bummer.

85
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:25,500
So

86
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:29,170
Just to be sure, take out the time wrap.

87
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,920
If you wrap it in a time wrap and rewind time

88
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:36,380
you will be able to tell if this is a dinosaur egg or not

89
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:37,970
It's not.

90
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:41,890
What are you going to do if it's really a dinosaur's egg after doing that?

91
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:43,640
I'll keep it.

92
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,650
It's too hard for Nobita

93
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,650
Why

94
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,770
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,770 To raise a life like this

95
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,400
It's not as easy as you think

96
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,530
And raising dinosaurs in a world where they're extinct

97
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:58,870
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:58,870 And they're so pathetic.

98
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,580
Before thinking about that kind of thing like a dream

99
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:05,460
Learn how to take care of yourself first

100
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:09,580
Give me back my gumbo!

101
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:13,880
That means Doraemon believes it's a dinosaur egg, too.

102
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,720
No, it's not.

103
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,340
If you don't believe me, take out the time wrapper.

104
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,810
It'll just end up as shit anyway

105
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,560
Time wrapped towel

106
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,280
That's fine

107
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,950
I can't wait!

108
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:45,870
Could it be a Triceratops or a Brachiosaurus?

109
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:47,710
I told you it's the poop of an Archaeopteryx.

110
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:49,920
I don't know, it could be a Tyrannosaurus.

111
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,880
Mum, what's for dinner today?

112
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:18,030
Huh? Nothing's changed.

113
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,070
Sure enough, it's probably just an ordinary stone.

114
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:26,330
Nobita also needs to sleep well

115
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:27,700
Good night

116
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:29,960
Good night

117
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,750
Nobita, get up!

118
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:19,800
It's itchy, Doraemon

119
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:30,930
Glasses Glasses

120
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,560
What's up, Nobita?

121
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:49,790
Do Doraemon

122
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,500
No, not sure it's a dinosaur yet.

123
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It's going to be born

124
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,460
Gotta get the hot water going

125
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,750
Ambulance. Ambulance. And... and...

126
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,610
It's a dinosaur.

127
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,240
So cute.

128
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:32,620
Huh

129
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,010
Do... Doraemon.

130
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,200
Double Yolk Egg

131
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,200
How rare!

132
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:11,780
Thanks to the time wrapped scarf

133
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:15,160
The twin dinosaurs inside the egg grow up

134
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,630
Slow down. It's dangerous.

135
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,170
That's great. You can walk already.

136
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,420
This child won't come out.

137
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:39,350
Look, it's not scary. Come on out.

138
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,330
So warm

139
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,420
So, your name is Khoo.

140
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:11,140
And you are Mew

141
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,850
Kew and Mew?

142
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:18,560
It's got little feathers. It's lovely.

143
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,900
What kind of dinosaur is this?

144
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:22,900
Let's investigate

145
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,780
The Complete Encyclopedia of the Universe

146
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:28,950
Speaking of dinosaurs with feathers

147
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:32,450
Dinosaur and also Chironomus

148
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,990
Not this one. Not this one either.

149
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:37,200
Oops

150
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:39,210
How can

151
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:43,330
This dinosaur has not been recorded

152
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,420
It must be a new species of dinosaur.

153
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:49,340
If that's the case, it's a big find.

154
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:52,140
Name it Nobita Dinosaur

155
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,180
But, Nobita, you can't keep them here.

156
00:14:56,890 --> 00:15:00,100
If Mom or anyone else finds out, it'll be a big deal.

157
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,860
No, I want to keep it.

158
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:07,690
I'll show them to Fat Tiger and Little Husband when they're old enough.

159
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,400
And leave them speechless

160
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:13,490
Please, Doraemon, can you just grow a little bit bigger?

161
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:17,870
Really, really cute.

162
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,790
Look at that. Isn't that nice?

163
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:22,830
You can only keep them until they grow up.

164
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,130
Great!

165
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,920
Please tell me more, Mew.

166
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:38,930
I'm full

167
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:42,770
What's wrong? You're eating so fast.

168
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:43,560
Dad

169
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:44,730
Thank you

170
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,940
Nobita, you've left the green peppers again, haven't you?

171
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,230
I ate it.

172
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:51,280
Mum, I'll have another bowl of miso soup too.

173
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:51,900
Okay, okay.

174
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,320
Eh, there's a lot left.

175
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,870
It's not good to be a picky eater.

176
00:15:58,990 --> 00:15:59,950
I'm full

177
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:15,130
You're hungry, aren't you? Come on, eat.

178
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:18,810
Eat up eat up

179
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:20,890
Come on, Kew, eat too.

180
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:26,980
Not eating?

181
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,690
It's obviously so tasty

182
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,940
So, this

183
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,740
Ming Miao will eat

184
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:53,130
Kew if you don't eat properly

185
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:54,510
What's wrong?

186
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:57,640
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:57,640 Mew will eat it, but Kew won't.

187
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,930
I don't care

188
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:04,770
Hello?

189
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,600
You said you wanted to keep them, but you said so yourself, Nobita!

190
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,770
I feel like you guys are so much alike

191
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:14,240
Who are you talking about and who are you talking about?

192
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,530
Because Nobita is just like their parents.

193
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,620
We have to think of more ways

194
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,960
What do dinosaurs eat anyway?

195
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,330
What kind of place do they live in?

196
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,670
It's a fossilized plant.

197
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,510
It's beautiful.

198
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:37,090
Hello

199
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:41,800
Please teach me how to keep dinosaurs

200
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,260
How to breed

201
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:47,350
What kind of nest to sleep in, what kind of food to eat, etc.

202
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:49,940
That's it.

203
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,150
When it comes to dinosaurs, there are also carnivorous and herbivorous species.

204
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,900
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,900 And how did that dinosaur look like

205
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:58,490
Also related to how it lived

206
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,110
For example

207
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:02,950
Although like a lizard

208
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:04,990
But with feathers

209
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:09,620
So, why don't we find out what lizards and birds eat?

210
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,500
Do they live near the mountains or do they live near the sea?

211
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:15,250
In this case the food would be different again

212
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:18,050
Oh, a dinosaur with feathers.

213
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:22,260
Nobita, little Dora, time to eat

214
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,600
Today it's sashimi with tuna

215
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:28,430
I had a nice tuna today, so I went for the luxury

216
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,890
This is what Nobita likes to eat

217
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,560
I'm on.

218
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,320
I'm on

219
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:51,750
Eat up

220
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:54,960
It's delicious. Eat up.

221
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:04,350
No?

222
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:24,370
Eaten

223
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,030
That's good, that's good. One more.

224
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,540
Oh, that's good.

225
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,710
It hurts.

226
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:35,710
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts

227
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:37,960
Really, Khoo.

228
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:42,260
Good pain, good pain, good pain

229
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,300
It's not good

230
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:22,670
Nobita

231
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:36,350
What's wrong with you? It's so late.

232
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,810
How can I cure the dinosaur?

233
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,150
Please

234
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,580
I checked it with the medical kit

235
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,290
It should get better.

236
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:55,080
Come on, Khoo.

237
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:01,630
Seems to have fallen asleep

238
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,420
Nobita, go to sleep too!

239
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,850
Good boy. Good boy.

240
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:29,660
Kew

241
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,330
I'm going out

242
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,840
Late. Late.

243
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,970
Nobe, look what time it is!

244
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:53,930
You go and stand in the corridor.

245
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:56,640
Yamada

246
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:58,190
Kawamura

247
00:21:59,230 --> 00:21:59,900
Izumo Sugi

248
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:04,610
Nobe Nobe Nobuo

249
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:07,030
I'm calling you.

250
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,450
What the hell!

251
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,950
to to

252
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:12,660
Sending you yesterday's question paper

253
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:15,870
It's not 0 marks

254
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:18,710
What kind of guy is happy with 3 points?

255
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:20,120
Win!

256
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,380
That's good. Keep it up.

257
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:26,630
Come on, Nobita.

258
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,550
Come on, Nobita!

259
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,630
Come on, one more time.

260
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:31,680
Very good

261
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,550
Not even close.

262
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:35,600
That's it.

263
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,810
Oh, it's great to have Nobita on the bottom

264
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,400
It's really great

265
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:46,900
I feel a little bit more confident.

266
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,070
It's true

267
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:52,320
Hm

268
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,490
When you've seen grown up Kew and Mew

269
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,620
Don't cry afterwards

270
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,330
I'm back

271
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:00,870
Xiao Qiu Xiao Miao

272
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:09,300
Welcome home

273
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,470
Did Mew just fly?

274
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:15,100
Yes, I was shocked too.

275
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,310
Khoo, Khoo, fly over here too.

276
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,200
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

277
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,240
But... it hurts.

278
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:41,910
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:41,910 If it becomes capable of flying, it won't be able to keep it in the room.

279
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:45,170
It's only a matter of time before mum finds out.

280
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,460
Why? Can't you do anything about it?

281
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:52,260
Yes, I'll look for it.

282
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:56,800
Diorama set for breeding

283
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:01,390
This is a diorama for keeping animals or bugs

284
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:02,810
Diorama?

285
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:05,060
First decide on the terrain

286
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:08,480
That's about right, isn't it?

287
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:10,360
Then it's with this

288
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:13,450
In the words of the fast miniatures manufacturing camera

289
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:18,700
No matter what it is, it can be turned into a small part.

290
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:20,830
You can arrange them freely inside

291
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:21,950
awesome

292
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,620
But... it's going to be discovered.

293
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,420
Don't worry, it's here.

294
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,290
With size adjustment

295
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,000
Size can also be adjusted freely

296
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,300
And then, if you reduce the size with the reduction light

297
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:42,140
Really wide

298
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,810
What's up, Nobita?

299
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,400
If people are here, no one can find them.

300
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:51,860
Okay, I've decided to build one here just for us.

301
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,650
Nobe Dinosaur Land.

302
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:57,820
Yoo-hoo

303
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,350
Wrong! Do the math again!

304
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,360
It's so noisy!

305
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,020
This way. This way.

306
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,820
Maths homework is difficult

307
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:21,740
That's right, it's really hard

308
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:38,630
Hey Nobita

309
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:41,180
Did you find the dinosaur?

310
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,300
Than practising the bar flip

311
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:47,180
How about practising chewing peanuts with your eyes?

312
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,480
No more practice

313
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:55,690
It doesn't bother me if I can't do this kind of thing

314
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,280
This is a safe place.

315
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:03,660
I'm coming too. I'm coming too!

316
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:06,200
This is it!

317
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,380
Do it, do it!

318
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:33,810
Mew, that's great!

319
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:39,030
In that case, I want them to be able to soar under the blue sky

320
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,280
That's fine.

321
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:44,240
This diorama has a weather adjustment function

322
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:45,370
What about, for example

323
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:09,350
Come on, it's Kew next.

324
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,400
A slide?

325
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:17,230
I think this should allow Kew to practice flying

326
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,570
That's right

327
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:20,980
Come on, Kew. Come here.

328
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:34,920
Right now

329
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:41,300
Is that okay?

330
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:45,260
Let's try again. With practice.

331
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,090
You'll be able to fly like a mu

332
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,350
It doesn't seem to like it

333
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:52,640
You can't do that. It just failed once.

334
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:55,310
If that happens, you won't be able to support yourself for long.

335
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:57,520
How dare you say such things, Nobita!

336
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:59,150
What a mouthful

337
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,950
It seems to be saying that it's OK to have this

338
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,330
Really

339
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,290
But why can't Kew fly?

340
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:15,410
It obviously looks exactly the same

341
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:18,210
Speaking of which, Mew's tail is a bit longer

342
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,840
Kew's tail is much shorter

343
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,420
Really!

344
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:25,880
And

345
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:28,590
Kew is much smaller than Mew

346
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,310
I didn't realise I'd grown up so much

347
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:41,860
It's time to...

348
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:43,820
I understand

349
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:51,070
What was it that Nobita said would be important

350
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:52,990
That goes without saying.

351
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,290
Definitely no dinosaurs to be found

352
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,960
Performing the peanut chewing with the eyes as promised

353
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:00,210
Show us

354
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:05,920
What is it? What is it? What is it?

355
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,930
What is this? What is this?

356
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,520
It's a real dinosaur.

357
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,900
This one is even better with all the fat!

358
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:23,360
Bastard, that's what a friend should say!

359
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,440
Me, me, me... I'm skinny as a bone.

360
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:28,450
I can't believe I'm eating peanuts

361
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:32,910
Nobita what the hell is going on here?

362
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:37,200
This is the new dinosaur I found, Nobita Dinosaur.

363
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:40,040
This is Khoo. That's Mew over there.

364
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,630
Don't be afraid

365
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,000
All three of them are my good friends

366
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:47,880
I'm so sorry.

367
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,930
What's that scream?

368
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:57,060
Nobita

369
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:03,360
Oh no, it's Mom. Doraemon.

370
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,400
No problem.

371
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:06,020
Reducing the light

372
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:08,150
Why is it a can of locusts

373
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:08,900
That's strange.

374
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,660
Anything is good. Get it out.

375
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:12,360
That's it.

376
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,410
Space Mobile Crayon

377
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:17,200
Use this red crayon to circle the range

378
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:19,370
You can then move to the position circled by the white crayon

379
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:21,120
Don't illustrate at this point

380
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:23,380
Maharishi

381
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,260
Nobita

382
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,890
Hello, Auntie

383
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,770
Beautiful today too.

384
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:45,310
I've been hearing barks lately

385
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:47,520
There's also inexplicably less food in the fridge

386
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,190
Did you have kittens and puppies in the house

387
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:56,120
I swear I don't have a cat or a dog

388
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:00,290
Is that so?

389
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,130
That's weird.

390
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:11,920
If it's actually a dinosaur that's being raised

391
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,680
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,680 Mom would have been scared to death

392
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:15,590
Oh no.

393
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:19,390
Mum! Is that a dinosaur?

394
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:22,980
It's true. It's a dinosaur no matter how you look at it.

395
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:24,390
Do... Doraemon.

396
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:31,860
Gone

397
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:33,740
Where the hell did it go?

398
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:42,040
All right, next up is Kew.

399
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,920
You've both grown so much

400
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:51,000
Nobita

401
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,510
It is no longer possible to continue to feed them in this era

402
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:56,970
Mew is already higher than me.

403
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:59,470
For them

404
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:02,430
Wouldn't it be better to live with your mates

405
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:06,020
But where do we send them back to?

406
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,730
Back to the time when they existed, right?

407
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,980
If you work backwards from the time spent on the Time Wrapper

408
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:13,240
is from the late Cretaceous

409
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,530
Go to that time with a time machine

410
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,910
Let Kew and Mew return to their companions

411
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:18,450
I don't want it!

412
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,700
Absolutely not!

413
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:24,080
Nobita

414
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,830
Nobita I understand that it hurts to be apart

415
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,590
But you can't stay together forever

416
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:34,210
This wasn't their world in the first place.

417
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:37,180
But Kew can't fly yet.

418
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:41,810
If we send it back to the age of dinosaurs, it's not going to survive!

419
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,310
But that's the principle

420
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:53,980
We can't change history

421
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:57,650
And if you grow with your companions

422
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:59,820
Kew can definitely fly too

423
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:02,080
So, Nobita

424
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,040
Tomorrow. Tomorrow, the two of us.

425
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,670
Let's send Kew and Mew back to the Cretaceous

426
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:13,550
Okay, it's late. Let's go back.

427
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:29,520
This kind of thing

428
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,560
Of course I understand

429
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:28,080
Well done. Well done.

430
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:30,290
Maharishi

431
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:36,920
Khoo and Mew

432
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:39,920
I was born from the egg because of my caprice

433
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,760
So I had to protect them.

434
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,970
Let's go. To the Cretaceous!

435
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,220
Go in search of Kew and Mew's companions

436
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,190
Nobita!

437
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:01,280
Fat Tiger, Little Fu, Shizuka

438
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:02,900
That costume is going to

439
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:06,070
You were planning to go to the Cretaceous anyway!

440
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,450
You're not going to leave us behind, are you?

441
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:10,370
I'd like to come along too

442
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:12,620
If I can be of any help, just ask.

443
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,630
Guys

444
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,890
Everybody, are you ready?

445
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,140
Sure.

446
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,520
The heart is beating

447
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:33,600
Departure

448
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:35,850
To the Cretaceous

449
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,400
Engine start

450
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:43,320
Battery charge 1200%

451
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:46,410
Time space navigation system fully operational

452
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:55,830
Destination 66 million years ago in Cretaceous Japan

453
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:58,080
Hold on tight, folks!

454
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:05,010
Doraemon Where are we now?

455
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,340
About 600 years ago

456
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,850
6,000 years ago

457
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:12,640
It was the time when the Egyptian civilization of the Nile Valley flourished

458
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:13,980
I know this one.

459
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:15,640
Time of the birth of man

460
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,650
It was about 2.5 million years ago

461
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:19,900
And the Cretaceous period we're going to is

462
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:21,820
More than 60 million years ago

463
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:24,530
Now about one ten thousandth of a mile away

464
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,530
One ten thousandth

465
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:30,160
You'll have to wait in here a little longer.

466
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:39,750
There will be occasional shaking, so hold on tight

467
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:51,890
Doraemon This is the Cretaceous Period?

468
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:56,140
Well, we've gone back 66 million years.

469
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:58,060
Okay, let's go.

470
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,150
Wait!

471
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:02,270
We're going to the Cretaceous later. The temperature is very different from now.

472
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:05,690
00:38:05,690 and the concentration of oxygen was also different than in our time

473
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:06,990
And so?

474
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,950
Expedition set

475
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:15,040
This suit is waterproof, windproof and coldproof in every way

476
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:18,540
It can be adapted to a wide variety of environments and thus protects itself

477
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:20,880
It feels like an expedition now.

478
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:22,380
Super suitable

479
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,050
So let's go

480
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:54,200
This is Japan in the Cretaceous period

481
00:38:58,790 --> 00:38:59,290
Come out

482
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:05,800
This is your hometown!

483
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,140
What is it?

484
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,760
Next, so that we don't get separated.

485
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:18,680
Locating the square scarf

486
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:21,850
Put this scarf around your neck like this

487
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:24,190
This button is the signal transmitter

488
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,610
When expanded, it becomes a map

489
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:30,110
This way we know where each other are at all times

490
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:33,620
Does that work?

491
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,120
So cute

492
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:38,040
Mew wants to put it on too, right?

493
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:40,160
We're the same colour

494
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:41,410
Kew also wears

495
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:43,670
That's good.

496
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:50,420
Then set off in search of Qiu and Miao's companions

497
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:52,970
I'll be the first to find them.

498
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,930
Me too

499
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,960
Why can't I see dinosaurs anywhere?

500
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:26,920
You're so ignorant, Fat Tiger. This is Japan.

501
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:29,630
How can there be large dinosaurs?

502
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,170
What's wrong, fat tiger?

503
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:34,340
What's the matter?

504
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:36,890
This way

505
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,850
Wait, Fat Tiger.

506
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,120
JD Dragon

507
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:00,080
It's a real dinosaur

508
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:02,200
Won't they attack us?

509
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,290
Stegosaurus is a herbivore

510
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:06,330
So just get close to it and you won't have any problems

511
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,040
To be precise, they're close relatives of Stegosaurus.

512
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:15,130
So it's true. There were many dinosaurs in Japan.

513
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:18,140
But something doesn't feel right.

514
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,510
What do you mean?

515
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:22,970
Isn't Stegosaurus a Jurassic dinosaur?

516
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,430
What do you mean?

517
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:28,440
Indeed, Stegosaurus is a Jurassic dinosaur.

518
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:32,400
If that's the case, this is 100 million years older than the Cretaceous.

519
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:34,360
Jurassic is correct.

520
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:36,240
100 million years

521
00:41:36,490 --> 00:41:38,240
But it shouldn't be

522
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:39,530
Does it mean that

523
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:58,590
Isn't that an Allosaurus that lived in the Jurassic?

524
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:01,550
It's not the Cretaceous period.

525
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:02,430
It's the Jurassic

526
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:04,140
But why would

527
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,230
Sorry

528
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,940
I may have accidentally pressed the wrong destination for the time machine

529
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:11,310
What the hell are you doing, Nobita?

530
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,230
You nerd

531
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:34,960
Everybody run full speed back to the time machine

532
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:37,130
Run!

533
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:41,260
Nobita, come on!

534
00:42:42,850 --> 00:42:44,060
Wait for me

535
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:03,830
Run away!

536
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:11,870
Nobita, come on!

537
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:14,590
Wait for me

538
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:17,710
Quick

539
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:31,350
Went to the Cretaceous?

540
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:33,610
Call Dr. Gill.

541
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:35,770
So crowded

542
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:38,110
Nobita, what about the diorama set?

543
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:39,320
I just lost it.

544
00:43:39,610 --> 00:43:41,360
Really, what can I say about you?

545
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:48,200
You're not going to get it wrong this time, are you?

546
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:49,500
Yes.

547
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:52,170
No mistake. This is Cretaceous Japan.

548
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:10,350
That's great. That's great!

549
00:44:10,810 --> 00:44:12,690
Doraemon It must be here!

550
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:16,810
Nobita, Shizuka, Kew and Mew are counting on you.

551
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:18,230
Okay, let's go!

552
00:44:18,610 --> 00:44:19,480
Come on, Kew.

553
00:44:19,610 --> 00:44:20,150
Little Mew

554
00:44:32,830 --> 00:44:34,420
This is Japan in the Cretaceous period

555
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,590
To be precise, the islands of Japan were not yet formed at this time.

556
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,960
It is still part of a huge continent

557
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:42,130
Look over there!

558
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:51,100
That's awesome!

559
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,690
It's the real Alamosaurus

560
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,310
This is too big

561
00:44:59,020 --> 00:44:59,730
Look over there.

562
00:45:24,970 --> 00:45:25,930
That's awesome

563
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:27,930
It's like a dinosaur kingdom

564
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:31,930
Is this the home of Kew and Mew?

565
00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:42,820
Flight practice Flight practice

566
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:47,660
Kew's not a birdie. Don't give him a hard time. All right, let's go.

567
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:49,780
Sorry sorry sorry

568
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:55,960
Say it's this way!

569
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:57,120
You know what?

570
00:45:57,290 --> 00:45:58,170
How can

571
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:07,800
What a beautiful lake

572
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:10,850
Look around here

573
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,890
Why can't I see dinosaurs anywhere?

574
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:16,310
Are they extinct?

575
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:20,480
How is that possible?

576
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:24,780
It's difficult because it's a new dinosaur, so there's no habitat in the database.

577
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,110
What are the clues?

578
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:31,070
Yeah.

579
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:34,700
Footprint stamp

580
00:46:35,450 --> 00:46:36,790
Footprint stamp?

581
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,040
Kew, come here.

582
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:41,080
Lend me your feet for a while

583
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:49,680
Ready

584
00:46:58,350 --> 00:46:59,100
What is this

585
00:47:00,310 --> 00:47:01,480
It's a footprint.

586
00:47:01,730 --> 00:47:03,690
If you stamp the ground like this

587
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:06,480
A footprint of the same shape will glow

588
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:08,320
I can't believe there are so many footprints

589
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:10,530
This is it.

590
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:13,570
Look, these footprints are all going in the same direction.

591
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:16,240
It must be a mass migration.

592
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,160
But why is that?

593
00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:38,560
Report the number!

594
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:53,030
Doraemon What's this?

595
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:54,700
Egg Expedition

596
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:57,290
They'll help us find the footprints

597
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:59,080
So cute

598
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:00,500
I'm counting on you then

599
00:48:12,550 --> 00:48:13,840
This is not edible

600
00:48:18,890 --> 00:48:20,220
Is it really okay?

601
00:48:20,890 --> 00:48:23,140
Stop talking nonsense and get after it!

602
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,560
No, it'll be dangerous if we fall behind.

603
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:27,520
Let's camp here today

604
00:48:33,990 --> 00:48:35,410
Camping Balloon

605
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:37,370
Sleep in this tonight

606
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,200
This way. This way.

607
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:45,370
There are rooms for everyone. Choose your favourite.

608
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:47,080
That's great. I'll take this one.

609
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:47,750
It's so slick.

610
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:48,750
Soft

611
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:52,260
Awesome

612
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:55,430
Great

613
00:48:55,430 --> 00:48:56,640
Great

614
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:57,930
And what else?

615
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:03,180
Raise the balloon like this

616
00:49:03,350 --> 00:49:04,890
And you won't be attacked by the beast!

617
00:49:10,570 --> 00:49:11,690
That's great!

618
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:36,930
Unbelievable, isn't it?

619
00:49:37,470 --> 00:49:40,850
We are now, 66 million years ago.

620
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:49,020
What a great meteor shower!

621
00:49:58,910 --> 00:50:00,240
There are monkeys in this era?

622
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:02,370
It's not surprising if there were

623
00:50:25,350 --> 00:50:27,060
Of course, I'm keeping an eye on them.

624
00:50:27,890 --> 00:50:29,230
Got it. What do we do?

625
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:30,600
Catch them now?

626
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:33,480
A little more observation

627
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:34,480
Understand

628
00:50:41,030 --> 00:50:42,580
Surely a new dinosaur

629
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:47,370
Why

630
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:54,840
Information about footprints came in from the egg expedition

631
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:57,920
Where exactly are they heading?

632
00:50:58,380 --> 00:50:59,630
Anyway, let's go.

633
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:02,600
Okay, everybody, don't get separated.

634
00:51:03,350 --> 00:51:04,050
All right?

635
00:51:11,770 --> 00:51:14,190
Is it true that you passed through here?

636
00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:22,160
What's wrong, Kew?

637
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:32,330
Doraemon Back!

638
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,380
Yes, it's a toothless pterodactyl.

639
00:51:38,630 --> 00:51:40,550
No, this is their lair.

640
00:51:41,090 --> 00:51:43,180
Everybody, run away at full speed.

641
00:51:44,850 --> 00:51:45,470
Kew

642
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:47,930
Doraemon

643
00:51:51,390 --> 00:51:53,230
Do these guys want to eat us?

644
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,020
This is better.

645
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:58,110
Is this what friends do?

646
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:07,240
No, no, they're not here to attack us.

647
00:52:07,490 --> 00:52:10,000
It looks like they're in a panic because they've been scared by something.

648
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,670
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,670 Everybody take refuge in the forest below

649
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:33,730
We're saved!

650
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:41,780
Doraemon Here are the footprints

651
00:52:42,570 --> 00:52:43,450
Really

652
00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:48,120
Egg Expedition

653
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:51,580
Footprints continue in front of this

654
00:52:51,870 --> 00:52:53,120
Thank you for your hard work

655
00:52:56,210 --> 00:52:57,540
This is not edible

656
00:52:59,590 --> 00:53:00,750
Be careful, everyone!

657
00:53:01,010 --> 00:53:02,880
There's no telling what kind of dinosaurs are lurking around here.

658
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:04,260
How so

659
00:53:04,630 --> 00:53:06,300
Dora, don't scare us!

660
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:09,850
You'll save us if we're in danger, right?

661
00:53:16,310 --> 00:53:17,400
Whatever it is that's coming

662
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:19,440
My lord would have sent it flying

663
00:53:28,410 --> 00:53:30,830
Rats are scary. Rats are scary.

664
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:34,210
Oh, really. Don't make a fuss.

665
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:37,580
There are animals like rats in this day and age.

666
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:40,750
Are you hungry, fat tiger?

667
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:42,380
It's not me

668
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:44,300
Want some chewing gum?

669
00:53:44,470 --> 00:53:45,550
I told you it wasn't me.

670
00:53:45,550 --> 00:53:46,130
Baba Baba Baba...

671
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:47,300
What's with the dad again?

672
00:53:49,430 --> 00:53:51,140
Tyrannosaurus rex!

673
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,250
Look here

674
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:22,710
Momotaro Rice Ball

675
00:54:23,250 --> 00:54:24,840
Broken

676
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:30,220
Cannot be eaten

677
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:34,470
Nothing else? Nothing else?

678
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:37,270
There you are. Chocolate partner.

679
00:54:37,850 --> 00:54:39,600
Chocolate at a time like this

680
00:54:41,230 --> 00:54:44,190
Divide this chocolate into two before giving it to the others

681
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:50,490
Then you can become friends with each other

682
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:51,780
is now

683
00:54:59,290 --> 00:55:00,170
not possible

684
00:55:05,130 --> 00:55:07,090
I'm not a civet

685
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:14,680
There should be more

686
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:15,890
Somebody help!

687
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:23,400
I'll take care of that.

688
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:32,450
It's so easy.

689
00:55:34,370 --> 00:55:35,580
What's going on?

690
00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:38,620
What are you doing? Let go!

691
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:44,290
Pain, pain, pain

692
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:48,010
Really? Your name is Gale.

693
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,300
Great, Fat Tiger.

694
00:55:51,510 --> 00:55:52,300
That's awesome!

695
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:54,350
Everyone, let me introduce you

696
00:55:54,470 --> 00:55:56,600
My friend from the heart, Gail

697
00:55:56,810 --> 00:55:58,520
That's nice, Fat Tiger.

698
00:55:58,810 --> 00:56:01,230
Sharing partner chocolates with each other after becoming partners

699
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:05,400
You can acquire each other's characteristics and abilities within one hour

700
00:56:05,650 --> 00:56:07,320
If you become friends with a dinosaur

701
00:56:07,610 --> 00:56:10,940
00:56:07,610 --> 00:56:10,940 then we can protect ourselves from being attacked in our search for Kew and Mew's companion

702
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:12,570
Good idea.

703
00:56:14,410 --> 00:56:16,950
Let's all become friends with our favourite dinosaur

704
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:18,200
That's great!

705
00:56:18,330 --> 00:56:20,500
Dinosaur sauce. Dinosaur sauce.

706
00:56:24,790 --> 00:56:25,630
With

707
00:56:27,710 --> 00:56:29,050
I want to be friends with little Mew

708
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:36,680
Same as Mew

709
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:46,520
If you don't mind, can you be my friend?

710
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:54,950
That's awesome.

711
00:56:55,530 --> 00:56:56,370
Let's do it too

712
00:56:59,490 --> 00:57:00,580
We're going, Kew.

713
00:57:01,870 --> 00:57:03,620
Let's fly

714
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:08,290
Pain, pain, pain, pain

715
00:57:11,130 --> 00:57:14,590
The flightless Qiu and Nobita are a perfect match

716
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,390
Triceratops

717
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:19,260
Only one horn. It must be one of its kind.

718
00:57:19,850 --> 00:57:21,060
It's called a trophy.

719
00:57:22,350 --> 00:57:23,680
Please tell me more, Topper.

720
00:57:26,770 --> 00:57:29,650
A friend of a friend is also a good friend

721
00:57:34,070 --> 00:57:35,110
It's okay.

722
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:39,450
One day, Kew will fly too.

723
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:42,330
Although I'm not qualified to say that either

724
00:57:44,830 --> 00:57:46,170
Everyone, let's go!

725
00:58:02,810 --> 00:58:03,430
And then

726
00:59:21,970 --> 00:59:22,590
It's the sea.

727
00:59:23,930 --> 00:59:26,430
The footprints have disappeared

728
00:59:29,310 --> 00:59:30,440
There are many footprints

729
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:32,480
Good work, everyone

730
00:59:36,570 --> 00:59:38,690
It seems that the footprints break off here

731
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:40,650
Where the hell did it go?

732
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,030
It didn't fall into the sea, did it?

733
00:59:43,950 --> 00:59:45,030
It can't be

734
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:47,370
It must be around here.

735
00:59:47,950 --> 00:59:50,250
Then let's split up and look for it.

736
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:52,460
That's too dangerous.

737
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:55,340
What's the matter, little Dora? Are you scared?

738
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:58,460
We have Gale and Topper with us.

739
01:00:00,590 --> 01:00:01,090
All right then.

740
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:03,010
But be careful

741
01:00:03,430 --> 01:00:05,850
In case it doesn't work in the middle of the day, take this with you

742
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:09,730
We'll use the scarf to confirm each other's positions

743
01:00:10,230 --> 01:00:10,850
I see

744
01:00:12,940 --> 01:00:13,650
Let's go too

745
01:00:20,490 --> 01:00:22,490
Fat Fat Tiger These are

746
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:24,570
Are they all dinosaur skeletons?

747
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:27,030
Let's go back.

748
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:29,200
What are you afraid of?

749
01:00:31,250 --> 01:00:32,870
What's wrong? Even Gale is like that.

750
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:35,210
Topper too, like he's afraid of something.

751
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:39,210
And I feel like I've been watched since a while ago.

752
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:54,770
See, Fat Tiger?

753
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:56,480
Let's go after it

754
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:06,450
Uh-huh.

755
01:01:10,410 --> 01:01:12,370
Gere and Topper are waiting for us right here.

756
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:15,960
Don't worry about it.

757
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:18,960
We'll be right back

758
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:27,300
Junior Expedition Departure Follow Me Purple Team

759
01:01:28,550 --> 01:01:29,550
Purple crew?

760
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:45,990
This is

761
01:01:46,990 --> 01:01:49,660
Cretaceous actually existed in this kind of place

762
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:53,790
Some bad guys would poach dinosaurs and sell them for a high price

763
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:56,250
I've heard Doraemon say that before

764
01:01:56,790 --> 01:01:58,500
Okay, let's both find out.

765
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:00,000
Let's go, purple team.

766
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:03,380
If I'm purple, what's a fat tiger?

767
01:02:03,670 --> 01:02:05,630
The captain is red of course

768
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:08,800
Not orange

769
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:12,680
Don't let me hear the word orange again

770
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:14,350
Yes Red

771
01:02:16,230 --> 01:02:18,310
Hey, look at this!

772
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:21,110
This is

773
01:02:21,860 --> 01:02:23,280
Similar to Kew and Mew

774
01:02:26,740 --> 01:02:27,860
Found it! Catch it!

775
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:30,490
Wait for me!

776
01:02:43,550 --> 01:02:44,960
Sure enough it's that monkey

777
01:02:45,170 --> 01:02:46,670
Very good. Go on, purple.

778
01:02:47,340 --> 01:02:48,590
Why me?

779
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:51,090
Red as captain should take the lead at times like this

780
01:02:51,220 --> 01:02:54,640
Scouting is a subordinate's job, isn't it? Come on, purple.

781
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:55,970
No, no, no. Red please.

782
01:02:56,060 --> 01:02:56,980
Purple

783
01:02:57,060 --> 01:02:58,020
Red

784
01:02:58,020 --> 01:02:58,690
Purple

785
01:02:58,850 --> 01:02:59,640
You're a bit noisy, aren't you?

786
01:03:01,940 --> 01:03:04,520
It's orange

787
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:17,370
Old Mother

788
01:03:17,370 --> 01:03:19,540
Mum

789
01:03:24,340 --> 01:03:25,630
Really

790
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:29,220
What a brave expedition

791
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:31,380
The Monkey Speaks

792
01:03:31,510 --> 01:03:33,600
You... You saved us, didn't you?

793
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:35,060
Half right

794
01:03:43,940 --> 01:03:45,980
Yes Yes people

795
01:03:46,110 --> 01:03:48,360
However, the other half of the answer is wrong

796
01:04:05,380 --> 01:04:08,510
Sure enough all the footprints disappeared off the coast

797
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:09,380
Little Dora

798
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:11,880
What's this one?

799
01:04:12,430 --> 01:04:13,800
Is that a footprint of something?

800
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:16,810
No, if it is, it's too big.

801
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:20,890
What's wrong, Mew?

802
01:04:22,230 --> 01:04:22,810
Qiu

803
01:04:32,860 --> 01:04:34,610
Do-Do-Do Doraemon

804
01:04:34,870 --> 01:04:36,070
So Big

805
01:04:39,910 --> 01:04:42,250
Everyone, use the bamboo dragonfly to escape!

806
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:01,100
Xiao Qiu

807
01:05:02,060 --> 01:05:03,180
Fly up, Khoo

808
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:07,980
Fly Up

809
01:05:08,610 --> 01:05:09,270
Nobita

810
01:05:20,620 --> 01:05:22,830
Flying up Khoo is flying up

811
01:05:44,350 --> 01:05:45,100
Da Xiong

812
01:05:45,390 --> 01:05:46,100
Nobita

813
01:06:10,710 --> 01:06:11,460
Qiu

814
01:06:38,820 --> 01:06:39,530
Kew

815
01:07:30,540 --> 01:07:31,540
Open Door

816
01:07:32,170 --> 01:07:35,250
Bastard! Let us out!

817
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,920
Where's this ship going?

818
01:07:38,340 --> 01:07:39,760
How do I know about such things

819
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:44,850
Is everything okay, Fat Tiger?

820
01:07:45,310 --> 01:07:46,890
Damn it, can't I?

821
01:07:47,060 --> 01:07:50,810
If it had such sharp teeth it would have broken the lock

822
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:56,190
There is still this solution

823
01:07:56,610 --> 01:07:58,230
O Friend of the Heart

824
01:07:59,740 --> 01:08:01,740
No mistake, it's Nobita's signal

825
01:08:02,110 --> 01:08:04,160
Must have been swept away by the current

826
01:08:04,740 --> 01:08:07,240
Little Dora, Nobita, he must be okay.

827
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:10,830
The expedition set should protect him, right?

828
01:08:13,170 --> 01:08:13,830
Nobita

829
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:33,850
Good Boy

830
01:08:40,150 --> 01:08:40,860
Here

831
01:08:41,530 --> 01:08:43,530
How did we get saved?

832
01:08:48,490 --> 01:08:49,160
Can we climb up?

833
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:11,890
Nobita

834
01:09:13,270 --> 01:09:14,020
Doraemon

835
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:17,060
Great, you're all right.

836
01:09:17,150 --> 01:09:18,190
Nobita

837
01:09:18,770 --> 01:09:19,820
Shizuka

838
01:09:19,900 --> 01:09:21,150
I'm so worried about you

839
01:09:23,150 --> 01:09:24,360
It's really good that you're okay

840
01:09:24,990 --> 01:09:26,990
But... what is this island?

841
01:09:27,070 --> 01:09:29,910
I just saw a dinosaur that looks exactly like Kew and Mew

842
01:09:31,410 --> 01:09:33,830
So, here's the new dinosaur...

843
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:42,840
What are you going to do?

844
01:09:44,590 --> 01:09:47,140
It looks like they've reached the island too.

845
01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:49,640
That's pretty good.

846
01:09:49,930 --> 01:09:51,010
You're really taking it in stride

847
01:09:51,850 --> 01:09:54,480
That island is a decisive place for the planet

848
01:09:55,140 --> 01:09:57,100
If anything changes because of them

849
01:09:57,610 --> 01:09:58,900
I understand everything

850
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:03,190
Already caught two of them

851
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:05,700
Hurry up and get away!

852
01:10:05,950 --> 01:10:07,780
How can I go back after being screwed so badly?

853
01:10:08,070 --> 01:10:09,700
But why this island?

854
01:10:11,740 --> 01:10:16,460
The new alternative dinosaurs are the underdogs, forced into a life on the move

855
01:10:16,870 --> 01:10:19,290
Finally cornered on a cliff by the sea

856
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:22,250
And from there gliding all the way to the island

857
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:24,670
Achieved a solitary boom

858
01:10:26,260 --> 01:10:29,010
Even so, the island is still a mystery

859
01:10:43,110 --> 01:10:44,690
It looks like it leads to a very deep place

860
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:47,700
Kew, wait!

861
01:10:50,950 --> 01:10:51,570
What's wrong?

862
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:53,120
So that was

863
01:10:53,450 --> 01:10:54,120
Go after it

864
01:11:17,690 --> 01:11:18,230
Little Mew

865
01:11:19,190 --> 01:11:20,310
Let's go too

866
01:11:21,060 --> 01:11:22,020
Quickly Khoo

867
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:27,050
So spectacular

868
01:12:27,630 --> 01:12:28,250
Look!

869
01:12:29,130 --> 01:12:30,970
Mew is already with them

870
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:44,150
Qiu, they are your companions

871
01:12:46,230 --> 01:12:46,730
Go on!

872
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:08,000
No, the battery is dead.

873
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:16,590
Is it okay?

874
01:14:07,770 --> 01:14:08,480
Qiu

875
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:16,200
Stop it, Mew!

876
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:19,240
That's too much

877
01:14:25,710 --> 01:14:26,580
Khoo too

878
01:14:28,210 --> 01:14:29,380
Qiu is also your partner

879
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:32,040
Why

880
01:14:33,630 --> 01:14:34,510
That's because

881
01:14:35,170 --> 01:14:36,340
Because it can't fly?

882
01:14:38,550 --> 01:14:40,140
Because it's small?

883
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:43,350
Because of the short tail?

884
01:14:47,390 --> 01:14:49,480
In that case I would definitely

885
01:14:50,020 --> 01:14:51,810
Help Kew learn to fly

886
01:14:53,530 --> 01:14:54,400
Nobita

887
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:02,910
Not much time left before meteorite impact

888
01:15:03,990 --> 01:15:06,120
It's almost time to get the kids under control

889
01:15:07,580 --> 01:15:09,290
Otherwise everyone could be buried here

890
01:15:11,130 --> 01:15:12,000
will die?

891
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:15,630
Can you wait a little longer?

892
01:15:17,090 --> 01:15:20,340
This new dinosaur is slightly different from all the individuals so far

893
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:23,050
And, about the enigmatic island

894
01:15:24,010 --> 01:15:25,810
01:15:24,010 --> 01:15:25,810 Perhaps we will soon be able to find out what it really is

895
01:15:29,020 --> 01:15:31,480
However, if we have less than two hours left, we'll be on the island too.

896
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:32,610
I see

897
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:40,150
Try again. Don't be afraid.

898
01:15:54,090 --> 01:15:54,920
This is not working

899
01:15:55,250 --> 01:15:56,750
Whether mu or other similar

900
01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:59,130
Neither will flutter their wings like that

901
01:15:59,470 --> 01:16:00,220
One more time

902
01:16:15,730 --> 01:16:18,110
That's not how you fly. Why can't you do it?

903
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:22,780
I'm sure you can do it too.

904
01:16:23,530 --> 01:16:24,700
Just a little more effort

905
01:16:40,090 --> 01:16:40,760
Qiu

906
01:16:46,050 --> 01:16:46,890
Fool

907
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:49,640
Nobita

908
01:17:03,490 --> 01:17:04,820
What just happened

909
01:17:06,330 --> 01:17:08,410
If Kew wants to survive in this world

910
01:17:08,740 --> 01:17:10,120
you must learn to fly

911
01:17:12,750 --> 01:17:14,620
But I'm not really in a position to say such things

912
01:17:15,460 --> 01:17:18,750
I can't do either the race or the test or the bar.

913
01:17:24,380 --> 01:17:25,680
No such thing

914
01:17:26,510 --> 01:17:28,970
Nobita knows the pain and sorrow of others

915
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:31,970
and can give companionship and dependence

916
01:17:33,060 --> 01:17:35,020
This is the kind of Nobita I like

01:17:35,020
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:43,280
Khoo must be waiting for Nobita too

918
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:51,410
Thank you, Shizuka.

919
01:17:53,290 --> 01:17:53,870
Here

920
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:56,420
Seeker's Cane

921
01:17:57,630 --> 01:17:58,250
Thanks a lot

922
01:18:19,900 --> 01:18:21,150
Looks like we've reached the island

923
01:18:21,820 --> 01:18:23,650
Let's get out of here while we still can, Fat Tiger.

924
01:18:24,030 --> 01:18:24,650
Fat Tiger

925
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:27,990
Come on, Purple

926
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:30,910
Do you want to continue investigating here?

927
01:18:31,740 --> 01:18:32,490
Look at this!

928
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:36,000
I mean, you don't look like an explorer, you look like a thief.

929
01:18:37,830 --> 01:18:39,460
Who the hell are those guys?

930
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:43,170
Is this a thumbnail sketch of the island?

931
01:18:44,130 --> 01:18:46,300
I feel like I've seen it somewhere before

932
01:18:51,720 --> 01:18:53,180
Could this island be

933
01:18:54,430 --> 01:18:56,390
We need to inform everyone quickly

934
01:20:15,510 --> 01:20:17,640
I'm sorry for saying such a mean thing.

935
01:20:18,310 --> 01:20:20,180
I obviously can't even do one thing myself

936
01:20:22,020 --> 01:20:25,400
But one day I'm going to learn how to flip a bar too

937
01:20:26,020 --> 01:20:26,980
So, Khoo too

938
01:20:27,730 --> 01:20:29,150
Don't give up so easily, Khoo too

939
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:35,870
That's the deal between us

940
01:21:00,730 --> 01:21:02,770
Meteor

941
01:21:12,950 --> 01:21:14,410
Little Dora The one just now was

942
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:17,030
This can't be

943
01:21:51,940 --> 01:21:53,440
Little Dora, this is

944
01:21:54,150 --> 01:21:55,700
How could I be so stupid?

945
01:21:55,780 --> 01:21:57,700
I can't believe I didn't even notice such a thing

946
01:21:58,200 --> 01:21:59,280
Doraemon

947
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:00,080
Shizuka

948
01:22:00,240 --> 01:22:00,830
Fat Tiger

949
01:22:00,950 --> 01:22:01,790
Little Husband

950
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,580
I'm glad you got here safely.

951
01:22:03,790 --> 01:22:05,870
What the hell just happened compared to this?

952
01:22:06,290 --> 01:22:07,500
Does it mean that this is

953
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:12,630
Nobita

954
01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:15,550
Gentlemen

955
01:22:16,090 --> 01:22:18,300
Doraemon What the hell is going on here?

956
01:22:21,060 --> 01:22:24,390
This is exactly 66 million years ago.

957
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:25,980
as expected

958
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:28,440
So that was a meteorite that just fell?

959
01:22:28,810 --> 01:22:29,560
No way.

960
01:22:30,110 --> 01:22:32,650
Meteorite crashes into Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico

961
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:36,200
The meteorite stirred up dust that would have spread over the whole earth

962
01:22:36,780 --> 01:22:38,240
What would be the result of that?

963
01:22:39,370 --> 01:22:40,780
There's no danger on this side, is there?

964
01:22:41,370 --> 01:22:43,660
Mexico is on the far side of the world, isn't it?

965
01:22:46,830 --> 01:22:49,750
Dust from the fall of a giant meteorite

966
01:22:50,460 --> 01:22:53,710
It will be accompanied by a heat wave sweeping the world

967
01:22:54,300 --> 01:22:56,340
Burning everything on the surface of the earth to the ground

968
01:23:01,140 --> 01:23:03,970
After this the cumulus clouds will block out the sun for a long time

969
01:23:04,350 --> 01:23:05,890
The temperature of the Earth is thus lowered

970
01:23:07,190 --> 01:23:08,060
The dinosaur metropolis

971
01:23:17,530 --> 01:23:18,110
Don't

972
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:20,030
I can't believe it's going to end like this

973
01:23:20,570 --> 01:23:23,240
But Doraemon will find a way to solve the problem, right?

974
01:23:23,450 --> 01:23:24,410
Just like it always does

975
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:26,250
Sorry Nobita

976
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:29,210
I Can't Change History

977
01:23:30,710 --> 01:23:31,460
Nobita

978
01:23:32,130 --> 01:23:33,290
Nobita, stop it!

979
01:23:33,500 --> 01:23:34,380
Nobita

980
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:36,880
No. What do you want to do?

981
01:23:38,300 --> 01:23:38,800
This is it

982
01:23:39,260 --> 01:23:40,680
That's the reversing clock.

983
01:23:41,090 --> 01:23:42,140
Give it back to me!

984
01:23:44,470 --> 01:23:45,390
Little Dora

985
01:23:47,390 --> 01:23:50,690
I'm going to use it to reverse time and send the meteor back into the universe

986
01:23:51,310 --> 01:23:53,110
Stop it, Nobita!

987
01:23:53,270 --> 01:23:53,900
This is the end

988
01:24:00,360 --> 01:24:01,780
Time Patrol

989
01:24:04,450 --> 01:24:06,660
Now leave the two new dinosaurs over there immediately

990
01:24:06,870 --> 01:24:08,660
Boarding Time Ship

991
01:24:09,080 --> 01:24:11,370
Otherwise you will be arrested for time crimes

992
01:24:12,210 --> 01:24:13,000
Arrested?

993
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:16,000
Fat Tiger

994
01:24:17,510 --> 01:24:18,300
In other words

995
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:20,800
Sorry for the bad memories

996
01:24:21,930 --> 01:24:24,930
01:24:24,930 To prevent history from being changed, we have been monitoring the times

997
01:24:24,970 --> 01:24:28,430
I say, can't we really help Kew and Mew?

998
01:24:30,230 --> 01:24:33,350
I've been studying dinosaurs for a long time because I like them too

999
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:34,730
I can understand how you feel

1,000
01:24:35,690 --> 01:24:38,610
But, sorry, we can't do anything to save them.

1001
01:24:39,650 --> 01:24:41,490
This is too cruel

1002
01:24:41,990 --> 01:24:43,820
The falsification of history must not be allowed

1003
01:24:44,820 --> 01:24:46,950
If you stop the meteor from falling, it's not just you.

1004
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:49,290
None of you will ever be born

1005
01:24:49,660 --> 01:24:50,620
How can this be

1006
01:24:51,210 --> 01:24:53,790
The mammals only flourished when the dinosaurs died out

1007
01:24:54,330 --> 01:24:56,290
And that's how humans came to be

1008
01:24:56,290 --> 01:24:57,250
I'm not going to save you from death

1009
01:24:58,300 --> 01:24:59,880
I could never do such a thing

1010
01:25:01,260 --> 01:25:04,720
I want to reverse time and send the meteor back to the universe

1011
01:25:06,260 --> 01:25:08,260
Can't do it, Nobita.

1012
01:25:08,350 --> 01:25:09,060
Keep him under control

1013
01:25:18,730 --> 01:25:20,150
Be honest with me

1014
01:25:20,240 --> 01:25:20,980
Stop it!

1015
01:25:21,110 --> 01:25:22,070
Got him under control.

1016
01:25:22,070 --> 01:25:23,820
I want to protect Khoo and Mew

1017
01:25:23,990 --> 01:25:25,240
Stop

1018
01:25:26,830 --> 01:25:28,620
What's wrong with this guy?

1019
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:30,830
This guy

1020
01:25:36,380 --> 01:25:37,540
We're here to help too

1021
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:39,750
I'm not going to let you arrest Nobita

1022
01:25:40,050 --> 01:25:42,880
Nobita is just trying to protect Khoo and Mew

1023
01:25:43,380 --> 01:25:44,550
Mum

1024
01:25:45,050 --> 01:25:47,090
Only a few hours left before the heatwave arrives here

1025
01:25:47,890 --> 01:25:48,890
Get everyone out of here.

1026
01:25:50,470 --> 01:25:51,060
One moment

1027
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:55,350
Can you give me a little more time?

1028
01:25:56,310 --> 01:25:59,310
Stop it, Jill. Everyone will be burned to the ground.

1029
01:26:11,540 --> 01:26:12,040
What

1030
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:20,000
Untie the boy!

1031
01:26:20,420 --> 01:26:22,050
Don't interfere with anything they do

1032
01:26:22,670 --> 01:26:24,260
What the hell is going on here, Jill?

1033
01:26:26,970 --> 01:26:27,470
sure enough

1034
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:29,680
as you can see

1035
01:26:30,260 --> 01:26:32,060
We cannot interfere with their actions

1036
01:26:33,020 --> 01:26:35,850
How about witnessing the moment when history is made

1037
01:26:40,150 --> 01:26:42,860
01:26:42,860 What about the Time Patrol? They're not approaching us.

1038
01:26:43,230 --> 01:26:44,780
What the hell is going on here?

1039
01:26:45,240 --> 01:26:47,490
The guy using is checking the card

1040
01:26:47,860 --> 01:26:51,240
Will react in case history is about to be rewritten

1041
01:26:51,780 --> 01:26:54,700
That it reacted to Nobita and Kew would mean

1042
01:26:56,410 --> 01:26:58,670
I can't imagine this kind of teenager who has the word ordinary written on his face

1043
01:26:58,670 --> 01:27:00,960
How to Change History

1044
01:27:01,170 --> 01:27:02,380
Pingfan is still really sorry for you

1045
01:27:02,670 --> 01:27:05,630
But Nobita was so handsome just now

1046
01:27:06,090 --> 01:27:07,470
No, I'm trying my hardest

1047
01:27:08,090 --> 01:27:09,720
So what should we do next?

1048
01:27:10,350 --> 01:27:12,390
That would be to save the dinosaurs, naturally

1049
01:27:12,890 --> 01:27:14,350
But how do we do it?

1050
01:27:15,810 --> 01:27:18,310
About that, right, Fat Tiger?

1051
01:27:18,690 --> 01:27:21,060
That's right, our Junior Expedition.

1052
01:27:21,190 --> 01:27:23,190
We've made a big discovery

1053
01:27:23,780 --> 01:27:25,690
It's better to see than to hear

1054
01:27:27,950 --> 01:27:29,450
What the hell is going on?

1055
01:27:29,990 --> 01:27:31,990
Look at that mountain. Does it look familiar?

1056
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:34,030
Like what?

1057
01:27:34,950 --> 01:27:36,040
That's what I thought before

1058
01:27:36,620 --> 01:27:38,710
It feels like a slide on that hill

1059
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:40,080
In that case

1060
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:42,000
Then this is

1061
01:27:42,540 --> 01:27:43,340
Single Pole

1062
01:27:45,460 --> 01:27:46,170
This is

1063
01:27:46,710 --> 01:27:47,630
Tyre Jumper

1064
01:27:48,970 --> 01:27:50,430
This hill has three holes

1065
01:27:50,930 --> 01:27:51,640
I see

1066
01:27:51,930 --> 01:27:53,640
This is the concrete pipe in the open space

1067
01:27:55,010 --> 01:27:56,100
Then here is

1068
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:08,240
Maharishi

1069
01:28:08,820 --> 01:28:10,860
There's no mistake, this is

1070
01:28:12,370 --> 01:28:14,030
Nobe Dinosaur Land

1071
01:28:16,240 --> 01:28:17,490
I can't believe it's written as Inuyasha again

1072
01:28:17,790 --> 01:28:19,750
No doubt it's Nobita's handwriting

1073
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:21,750
The dinosaurs' lair is actually a climbing frame

1074
01:28:22,580 --> 01:28:23,380
I see

1075
01:28:24,090 --> 01:28:27,460
Device dropped in the Jurassic damaged the size adjustment

1076
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:30,260
got bigger between 100 million years

1077
01:28:33,260 --> 01:28:35,600
And so in the long years

1078
01:28:35,810 --> 01:28:38,220
It became just like an island of nature ah

1079
01:28:38,310 --> 01:28:38,810
That's right.

1080
01:28:39,850 --> 01:28:43,400
If the island is a diorama set, then it has a weather adjustment function

1081
01:28:44,190 --> 01:28:46,980
It should protect the dinosaurs from outside disasters

1082
01:28:47,110 --> 01:28:47,610
Awesome

1083
01:28:47,690 --> 01:28:50,320
But what about the dinosaurs off the island?

1084
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:51,490
Then

1085
01:28:51,570 --> 01:28:53,490
Can we use that prop?

1086
01:28:53,870 --> 01:28:55,740
The prop that moved Qiu and Miao to the roof

1087
01:28:56,370 --> 01:28:57,490
There's still this one

1088
01:28:57,870 --> 01:28:58,870
And this?

1089
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:00,620
That means space moving crayon

1090
01:29:01,660 --> 01:29:03,790
Fat Tiger, Xiao Fu, Shizuka, Miao

1091
01:29:04,250 --> 01:29:06,080
You go to the mainland outside the island

1092
01:29:06,420 --> 01:29:08,420
Gather the dinosaurs in one place as far as you can

1093
01:29:08,590 --> 01:29:10,300
Use this red crayon to draw a circle around them

1094
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:12,220
Nobita Khoo and I will

1095
01:29:12,380 --> 01:29:14,890
Drawing a circle around the island with a white crayon

1096
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:17,550
Press this button when you have finished drawing

1097
01:29:17,810 --> 01:29:20,640
Move all the dinosaurs from outside the island to here

1098
01:29:24,060 --> 01:29:25,480
Awesome

1099
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:27,810
This way everyone is saved

1100
01:29:28,440 --> 01:29:30,820
Great, Khoo Mew!

1101
01:29:33,820 --> 01:29:35,110
But time is running out

1102
01:29:35,370 --> 01:29:38,700
Let's finish before the heatwave hits, although it's extremely dangerous

1103
01:29:39,240 --> 01:29:41,700
But we still have hope

1104
01:29:42,910 --> 01:29:44,620
Okay, let's do it.

1105
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:50,630
Okay, let's start the battle to save the dinosaurs.

1106
01:29:54,340 --> 01:29:55,720
They're acting a little suspicious.

1107
01:29:56,760 --> 01:29:58,430
If something goes wrong, can you take responsibility for it?

1108
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:01,310
This could become

1109
01:30:01,560 --> 01:30:04,270
A decisive moment in the evolutionary history of living things

1110
01:30:04,270 --> 01:30:06,350
Can we wait a little longer?

1111
01:30:08,150 --> 01:30:09,820
One more hour

1112
01:30:10,230 --> 01:30:12,190
Take them away when the time is up

1113
01:30:12,860 --> 01:30:13,360
Got it

1114
01:30:22,870 --> 01:30:23,500
Let's go too

1115
01:30:26,670 --> 01:30:27,920
Kew is waiting here

1116
01:30:29,460 --> 01:30:31,250
There are no more working bamboo dragonflies

1117
01:30:36,220 --> 01:30:39,300
It doesn't matter, Kew will be able to fly too.

1118
01:30:40,100 --> 01:30:41,260
I thought we had a date

1119
01:30:41,430 --> 01:30:42,600
Let's go Nobita

1120
01:31:01,740 --> 01:31:03,790
Enclose the whole island as large as possible

1121
01:31:06,370 --> 01:31:07,040
Danger

1122
01:31:09,880 --> 01:31:10,710
It's that guy again

1123
01:31:10,750 --> 01:31:11,880
Why is it here

1124
01:31:15,550 --> 01:31:16,470
Flying away

1125
01:31:17,590 --> 01:31:19,130
Over there is the dinosaurs' lair

1126
01:31:19,340 --> 01:31:21,760
Oh no, Nobita continues to draw down

1127
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:22,470
Doraemon

1128
01:31:31,980 --> 01:31:33,060
I can't believe it's not working

1129
01:31:34,530 --> 01:31:35,110
so big

1130
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:36,070
That one is

1131
01:31:36,860 --> 01:31:37,940
It's too dangerous, isn't it?

1132
01:31:46,870 --> 01:31:47,410
Is it coming?

1133
01:31:55,670 --> 01:31:59,090
Shizuka drawing as big a circle as she can here

1134
01:31:59,430 --> 01:32:01,760
Let's go lure all the dinosaurs over here

1135
01:32:01,970 --> 01:32:02,680
Got it.

1136
01:32:02,970 --> 01:32:03,970
Look at that

1137
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:05,310
Oh no.

1138
01:32:05,890 --> 01:32:08,020
That's the heat wave that exterminated the dinosaurs

1139
01:32:08,390 --> 01:32:09,060
Hurry up

1140
01:32:19,070 --> 01:32:20,450
Egg Expedition

1141
01:32:20,910 --> 01:32:22,530
Let's get these guys to help out too

1142
01:32:23,070 --> 01:32:23,780
Please.

1143
01:32:27,370 --> 01:32:28,700
This is not edible

1144
01:32:29,080 --> 01:32:32,790
But how do we get the dinosaurs to listen to us?

1145
01:32:33,630 --> 01:32:35,460
This is where we need to use that, isn't it Fat Tiger?

1146
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:37,130
That's right.

1147
01:32:39,170 --> 01:32:39,970
Gere

1148
01:32:40,050 --> 01:32:41,050
Torp

1149
01:32:43,430 --> 01:32:46,510
You're here too, my friend of the heart.

1150
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:48,430
I'm so glad you're all right.

1151
01:32:48,470 --> 01:32:50,140
Gert Torp

1152
01:32:51,640 --> 01:32:53,900
They don't understand what people say

1153
01:32:54,520 --> 01:32:56,940
They always listen to what their friends say, don't they?

1154
01:32:59,030 --> 01:33:00,900
Air Cannon

1155
01:33:05,990 --> 01:33:07,030
This way

1156
01:33:10,250 --> 01:33:12,580
By the way, if you make him smaller with the shrinking light

1157
01:33:13,250 --> 01:33:15,130
Shrinking Lamp

1158
01:33:15,540 --> 01:33:17,290
Why are all the cans of locusts

1159
01:33:25,510 --> 01:33:26,340
Doraemon

1160
01:33:42,450 --> 01:33:42,940
Oh no

1161
01:33:44,360 --> 01:33:45,410
Run, Kew!

1162
01:33:47,530 --> 01:33:48,370
Come this way

1163
01:33:57,080 --> 01:33:58,420
Run, Kew!

1164
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:04,470
I said run, run, run!

1165
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:25,650
Come on, come on, run, Kew.

1166
01:34:42,550 --> 01:34:45,130
This way! Come this way!

1167
01:34:46,340 --> 01:34:47,010
Come on, this way!

1168
01:34:48,720 --> 01:34:50,300
Everybody, this way!

1169
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:51,930
Don't panic

1170
01:35:10,780 --> 01:35:11,450
Done

1171
01:35:17,870 --> 01:35:19,670
Please, just a little slower.

1172
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:25,380
Do you want to keep reading?

1173
01:35:26,010 --> 01:35:28,050
At this rate their lives will be in danger too

1174
01:35:28,930 --> 01:35:31,260
Wait a little longer. Wait a little longer.

1175
01:35:36,060 --> 01:35:36,850
Kew

1176
01:35:46,650 --> 01:35:48,650
Come on, it's Khoo's turn this time!

1177
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:54,120
Come on, Khoo, this way.

1178
01:36:12,140 --> 01:36:13,470
It's too dangerous. Let's get out of here.

1179
01:36:13,800 --> 01:36:16,890
Wait a minute. Look, the new dinosaur.

1180
01:36:36,830 --> 01:36:38,240
Come on, Khoo.

1181
01:36:53,260 --> 01:36:54,180
This won't work

1182
01:36:54,390 --> 01:36:55,850
Whether it's mu or something else like that

1183
01:36:56,060 --> 01:36:58,260
Neither will flutter their wings like that

1184
01:37:08,440 --> 01:37:09,360
It's okay, right?

1185
01:37:10,740 --> 01:37:13,360
With practice, you'll be able to fly just like Mew!

1186
01:37:17,080 --> 01:37:19,370
Kew, you can fly.

1187
01:37:20,200 --> 01:37:20,750
I must too

1188
01:37:21,160 --> 01:37:22,000
Someday

1189
01:37:23,170 --> 01:37:26,290
I'll definitely learn to flip the bar too

1190
01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:28,000
So, Khoo too

1191
01:37:29,300 --> 01:37:30,760
Don't give up so easily, Khoo too

1192
01:38:05,120 --> 01:38:05,790
Fly!

1193
01:38:21,470 --> 01:38:23,350
Fly Fly up

1194
01:38:29,020 --> 01:38:30,900
Go Go Go

1195
01:38:35,650 --> 01:38:38,110
Fly up, Kew!

1196
01:38:45,790 --> 01:38:46,500
Khoo!

1197
01:38:46,960 --> 01:38:48,880
Your name is Khoo

1198
01:39:10,310 --> 01:39:10,980
Flying up

1199
01:39:11,860 --> 01:39:15,070
Kew Flying up

1200
01:39:31,090 --> 01:39:32,210
Khoo So good

1201
01:39:34,090 --> 01:39:37,130
It's flying. You're not flying.

1202
01:39:41,390 --> 01:39:42,050
Here we go again

1203
01:39:44,890 --> 01:39:46,350
Oops, here it is

1204
01:39:48,600 --> 01:39:49,390
Where's Nobita?

1205
01:39:49,810 --> 01:39:50,810
Doraemon

1206
01:39:50,850 --> 01:39:51,480
Nobita

1207
01:39:53,440 --> 01:39:55,360
Watch me, this time for sure

1208
01:39:55,940 --> 01:39:57,400
Tinned Locusts!

1209
01:39:57,740 --> 01:39:58,530
Coming out

1210
01:39:59,700 --> 01:40:01,860
Nobita, just like that, flying straight over

1211
01:40:02,740 --> 01:40:03,370
Doraemon

1212
01:40:04,370 --> 01:40:06,330
Shrinking Lamp

1213
01:40:15,590 --> 01:40:16,840
Success Doraemon

1214
01:40:17,420 --> 01:40:20,050
Nobita, we don't have time. Get the crayons out.

1215
01:40:25,140 --> 01:40:26,930
After that, it's all yours.

1216
01:40:31,900 --> 01:40:34,360
Just go like that

1217
01:40:34,980 --> 01:40:35,610
Flying up

1218
01:40:36,070 --> 01:40:39,280
Flying up This is the moment of evolution

1219
01:40:39,860 --> 01:40:41,150
That awkward looking movement

1220
01:40:41,570 --> 01:40:43,660
Is that the precursor to soaring wings?

1221
01:40:44,240 --> 01:40:47,080
That's how dinosaurs once learned to fly on wings from gliding

1222
01:40:47,450 --> 01:40:49,000
Took the first step to evolve into a bird

1223
01:40:49,710 --> 01:40:53,790
We are now witnessing this moment of evolution

1224
01:40:54,840 --> 01:40:56,170
They didn't go extinct

1225
01:40:56,710 --> 01:40:58,920
but became birds to survive

1226
01:40:59,670 --> 01:41:01,220
If the boy hadn't been here

1227
01:41:02,050 --> 01:41:04,140
Guarding the words of that new dinosaur

1228
01:41:05,050 --> 01:41:07,930
The history of the earth may be about to change

1229
01:41:09,520 --> 01:41:10,520
Shizuka

1230
01:41:10,640 --> 01:41:12,100
Xiaowu Xiaofu

1231
01:41:12,690 --> 01:41:13,900
Pretty much all in one place

1232
01:41:14,230 --> 01:41:16,020
Still haven't connected with Doraemon?

1233
01:41:18,980 --> 01:41:20,280
Hey, little Dora.

1234
01:41:20,570 --> 01:41:21,940
Shizuka, how's it going over there?

1235
01:41:22,070 --> 01:41:22,860
Ready to go.

1236
01:41:22,860 --> 01:41:23,570
Do it!

1237
01:41:23,570 --> 01:41:24,450
It's burning.

1238
01:41:24,450 --> 01:41:25,990
Okay, ready to move.

1239
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,000
Khoo, come on!

1240
01:41:32,620 --> 01:41:33,210
III

1241
01:41:40,260 --> 01:41:41,880
Running out of crayons

1242
01:41:45,680 --> 01:41:46,260
Saw it

1243
01:41:51,310 --> 01:41:52,020
Zero

1244
01:42:57,880 --> 01:43:00,750
Nobita, are you sure you don't want to say goodbye?

1245
01:43:02,050 --> 01:43:05,210
Saying goodbye will only make the separation more painful

1246
01:43:07,260 --> 01:43:11,640
It's our turn now. Let's go back to our time.

1247
01:43:17,770 --> 01:43:19,810
01:43:17,770 --> 01:43:19,810 Take care, Gull.

1248
01:43:20,230 --> 01:43:22,440
We'll always be good friends

1249
01:43:22,440 --> 01:43:23,480
Thank you, Topper.

1250
01:43:28,280 --> 01:43:29,570
See you later

1251
01:43:29,780 --> 01:43:30,740
Take care!

1252
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:44,130
Don't come with me. You can't come with me.

1253
01:43:46,670 --> 01:43:49,680
You have to survive here

1254
01:43:51,550 --> 01:43:53,470
Be sure to stay alive

1255
01:43:54,640 --> 01:43:56,640
I'm sure you'll make it

1256
01:44:19,500 --> 01:44:21,210
Khoo, take care.

1257
01:44:21,500 --> 01:44:23,630
Miao Goodbye

1258
01:44:23,670 --> 01:44:24,290
Goodbye

1259
01:44:45,320 --> 01:44:46,070
Someday

1260
01:44:46,900 --> 01:44:48,360
We'll meet again

1261
01:44:51,150 --> 01:44:52,700
A Heart for Others

1262
01:44:53,570 --> 01:44:57,290
Perhaps this feeling is something that only humans have evolved to be able to produce

1263
01:44:58,250 --> 01:45:01,160
Like the dinosaurs evolved the ability to fly on wings

1264
01:45:01,960 --> 01:45:05,330
Humans have also evolved a wealth of emotions

1265
01:45:06,300 --> 01:45:08,840
Looking at them makes me think this way

1266
01:45:32,570 --> 01:45:33,650
Nobita

1267
01:45:34,160 --> 01:45:36,620
I can't keep sleeping in even if I'm on summer vacation

1268
01:45:36,700 --> 01:45:37,580
Get up!

1269
01:46:21,370 --> 01:46:22,120
It's turning over

1270
01:50:09,470 --> 01:50:11,890
Everyone, isn't it wonderful?

1271
01:50:12,270 --> 01:50:14,020
We'll see you next time
